# .NET Core 2 Web API
This application is a C# Web API Written in Microsofts .NET Core 2 Framework. I created it following Kevin Dockx PluralSight video, Building your First API with ASP.NET Core. It represents a RESTful API that would access a resource containing information about different cities.

## Resources
I used Postman to make various calls to the API. I exported all of those calls in put them in the root of the project. The file is PostmanApiCalls.json. You can import that file right into Postman and it will be a folder containing various calls to the API. URLs should be changes accordingly.

The API was built using Visual Studio 2015.
